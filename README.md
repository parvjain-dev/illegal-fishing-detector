# AI-Powered Illegal Fishing Detection

## About The Project

This project uses public vessel tracking data and satellite images to detect and predict illegal fishing activities worldwide. It combines data analytics, classic AI, and deep learning to provide real-time insights and visualizations on a map dashboard.

## Built With

- Python
- Pandas, GeoPandas (for data handling and geospatial analysis)
- Matplotlib (for plotting)
- Streamlit (for web app interface)
- scikit-learn (for classic AI models)
- PyTorch/TensorFlow (for deep learning)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo or create your project folder.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment.
3. Install required libraries:

## Usage

- Download sample vessel and satellite data.
- Run Python scripts to explore and analyze data.
- Launch Streamlit app to visualize illegal fishing hotspots.

## Roadmap

- Data ingestion and cleaning pipeline
- Basic analytics and visualization
- AI model for anomaly detection
